## üöß Under Development

This project is still in an **alpha stage**. Implementation is not complete. Expect rapid changes and incomplete features.

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Flow-Registration - variational optical-flow motion correction for 2-photon (2P) microscopy videos and volumetric 3D scans.

This MCP server provides programmatic access to Flow-Registration functionality through the Model Context Protocol, enabling AI assistants and other MCP clients to perform motion correction on microscopy data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- FastMCP framework

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlowRegSuite/flowreg-mcp.git
cd flowreg-mcp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup as MCP Server

To use this as an MCP server with Claude Desktop or other MCP clients:

1. Install the MCP server:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

2. Configure your MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop) to connect to the server:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flowreg": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "flowreg_mcp"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/flowreg-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Getting started

Once configured, the MCP server exposes Flow-Registration functionality through standard MCP tools and resources. The server provides motion correction capabilities for microscopy data through a programmatic interface.


## Dataset

The dataset which we used for our evaluations is available as [2-Photon Movies with Motion Artifacts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fPdzQo5SiA-62k4eHF0ZaKJDt1vmTVed?usp=sharing).
